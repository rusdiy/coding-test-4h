# Multimodal Document Chat System - Coding Test (AI Context Architect & Engineering Lead)

## Project Overview

**Focus**: Verify capability as an **AI Context Architect & Engineering Lead**.  
**Goal**: Build a system that parses PDF documents (text/image/table), constructs a retrieval workflow, and provides accurate answers via a multimodal chat interface.

> **Why this test?**  
> We are looking for a leader who can design the "Context" for LLMs, not just write code. We want to see your ability to design robust **Multimodal Workflows** and demonstrate **Technical Leadership** through architectural decisions.

## Core Competencies to Evaluate

1. **Context Engineering**: Ability to design data structures (Chunking, Embedding, Metadata) for optimal LLM understanding.
2. **Multimodal Workflow**: Ability to orchestrate text, images, and tables into a single coherent workflow.
3. **Technical Leadership**: Ability to diagnose bottlenecks, ensuring quality and performance.

The following items are **already implemented and provided**:

### Infrastructure Setup
- Docker Compose configuration (PostgreSQL+pgvector, Redis, Backend, Frontend)
- Database schema and models (SQLAlchemy)
- API base structure (FastAPI)
- Frontend base structure (Next.js + TailwindCSS)

### Database Models

## Core Features to Implement (Your Job)

Scale: **3 Core Features + 3 Design Deliverables**

### Part A: System Implementation (Implementation)

#### 1. Document Processing Pipeline (Critical)
**Location**: `backend/app/services/document_processor.py`
**Goal**: Parse PDF and structure data for Retrieval.

```python
class DocumentProcessor:
    async def process_document(self, file_path: str, document_id: int) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """
        Implementation steps:
        1. Parse PDF using Docling
        2. Extract and chunk text (Context Engineering)
        3. Extract images/tables and create meaningful metadata linkage
        """
        pass
```

#### 2. Vector Store Integration (Critical)
**Location**: `backend/app/services/vector_store.py`
**Goal**: Store projections of multimodal data.

```python
class VectorStore:
    async def store_text_chunks(self, chunks: List[Dict[str, Any]], document_id: int) -> int:
        pass
    
    async def search_similar(self, query: str, document_id: Optional[int] = None, k: int = 5) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
        """
        Retrieve context with high relevance. 
        Think about how to retrieve 'Tables' or 'Images' associated with text chunks.
        """
        pass
```

#### 3. Multimodal Chat Engine (Critical)
**Location**: `backend/app/services/chat_engine.py`
**Goal**: Generate grounded answers using retrieved context.

```python
class ChatEngine:
    async def process_message(self, conversation_id: int, message: str, document_id: Optional[int] = None) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """
        Orchestrate the RAG flow:
        1. Retrieve context (Text + Image + Table)
        2. Construct Prompt (Prompt Engineering)
        3. Generate Response via LLM
        """
        pass
```

### Part B: Design & Leadership (New Requirements)

In addition to code, please include the following in your `README.md` or separate markdown files (e.g., `DESIGN.md`).

#### 1. [Design Choice Document]
*   **Chunking Strategy**: Why did you choose this specific chunk size/overlap? Did you consider semantic chunking?
*   **Multimodal Linking**: How did you logically link extracted images/tables to text? (e.g., spatial proximity, explicit references in text?)

#### 2. [Evaluation Pipeline Design]
*   **Quality Metrics**: How will you measure the accuracy of answers? (e.g., "If I were to build an eval pipeline, I would check X, Y, Z...")
*   **Metrics**: Mention specific metrics like RAGAS (faithfulness, answer relevance) or LLM-as-a-judge approaches.

#### 3. [Prompt Versioning Strategy]
*   **Management**: Did you hardcode prompts? If you were to scale this, how would you manage prompt versions?
*   **Proposal**: Suggest a strategy to separate prompts from code (e.g., external templates, prompt registry).

## Sample PDF for Testing

**📄 Test Document**: ["Attention Is All You Need" Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762.pdf)

Use this document to demonstrate:
1. **Architecture Diagram Retrieval**: Can it find Figure 1?
2. **Table Data Retrieval**: Can it answer questions about BLEU scores?
3. **Technical Context**: Can it explain "Self-Attention" using specific sections?
